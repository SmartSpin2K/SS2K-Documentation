SmartSpin2k is an open source device that allows you to turn any spin bike into a smart trainer. With SmartSpin2k, you can connect your spin bike to Zwift, TrainerRoad, or other popular training apps. This allows you to control your exercise bike's resistance automatically, track your performance, and compete with other riders online.

All of the current Smart Trainer modes are supported including ERG mode!

Most bikes are supported but if you don't have a Peloton Bike, Schwinn IC4 or Echelon, you'll most likely need a bluetooth power meter.
