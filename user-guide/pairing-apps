#### How do I connect SS2K to Zwift?

Once you have completed your Bluetooth sensor pairing to the SmartSpin2k, you are ready to connect to Zwift. As mentioned previously, your best performance will likely result in pairing all sensors to the SmartSpin2k, followed by pairing the SmartSpin2k to your preferred Zwift device.

Login to Zwift, make sure your device has Bluetooth switched on, and click on “Smart Trainer”.

On this page, click on each sensor type (HR, Power, Cadence, and Smart Trainer), and Select SmartSpin2k as the source. Each item should have a blue background and be indicating the sensor value. If there are any issues, usually a “scan and reconnect” by holding the shifter buttons simultaneously will resolve any problems.
