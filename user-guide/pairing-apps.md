# How to pair SmartSpin2k to your training app

Once you have completed your Bluetooth sensor pairing to the SmartSpin2k, you are ready to connect to your training app. As mentioned previously, your best performance will likely result in pairing all sensors to the SmartSpin2k, followed by pairing the SmartSpin2k to your training app.

While the following instructions are for Zwift, most training apps behave the same way.  For a full list of compatible apps, check out the [Compatibility](compatibility) page 

1. Login to Zwift, make sure your device has Bluetooth switched on, and click on “Smart Trainer”.
1. On this page, click on each sensor type (HR, Power, Cadence, and Smart Trainer), and Select SmartSpin2k as the source. Each item should have a blue background and be indicating the sensor value. 

{: .caution }
If there are any issues, usually a “scan and reconnect” by holding the shifter buttons simultaneously will resolve any problems.
