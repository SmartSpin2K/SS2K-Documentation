Test the shift buttons to make sure the SmartSpin2k can rotate the resistance knob with a few shifts in each direction. If the SmartSpin2k is encountering difficulty rotating the knob, it may be that your resistance knob assembly requires some maintenance. Cleaning and lubricating should solve this. There is also an option in the Settings page which can increase the torque of the SmartSpin2k motor as different spin bikes may require different torque power.

Now move on to Pairing Bluetooth Sensors! If you prefer to ride without connecting to any smart trainer service, you can now use the SmartSpin2k and control resistance with the shift buttons.
