## Wiring Installation
As of December, 2024, we have migrated to a new cable design for the SmartSpin2k.  This is a minor improvement over the previous design and the wires are clearly labeled for ease of use.  

1. Identify your cable below and follow the appropriate installation instructions
    * The V1 breakout cable shipped with a 3.5mm Y cable and an aux cord for peloton and for the shifter.  The breakout cable will have three connectors for power, shifter, and Peloton, as pictured below

    * The V2 breakout cable will have four connectors for power, shifter, Peloton Tablet, and Peloton Sensor, as pictured below:

    Peloton Bike owners should continue with the Peloton [wiring and setup instructions](peloton).
    Bike+ requires a power meter.  Proceed with the wiring instructions below.

2. Connect the power adapter and shifter to your breakout cable as pictured above.

1. Connect the SmartSpin2k cable to the breakout cable.  Notice the arrows on the cables indicating the correct orientation for connection. If preferred, you can disconnect the cables between rides.
