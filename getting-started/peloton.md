## Choosing Your Operating Mode
Peloton Bike users have three options for using SmartSpin2k, each offers unique features and setup requirements:
- **Tablet Mode**: Ideal for those who use Peloton's digital services directly on the bike's tablet.
- **Headless Mode**: Suitable for users who prefer using third-party apps and do not use Peloton's digital services.
- **Bluetooth Mode**:  Users with power meter pedals will want to use this option. 

Select the mode that aligns with your usage preferences, and follow the setup instructions below for your chosen mode.

{: .caution }
Peloton Bike+ owners need a power meter for compatibility with SmartSpin2k.

## Automatic Resistance in Peloton Workouts
Through the use of Qdomyos-Zwift, it's possible to have automatic resistance for your instructor-guided rides in Peloton.  For this to work, you will need to use Tablet Mode and a secondary Android/iOS device running Qdomyos-Zwift.  If you'd like to use Qdomyos-Zwift, please reach out to members of their community for help and configuration. [Learn more here.](https://www.qzfitness.com/)
