## Choosing Your Operating Mode
Peloton Bike users have three options for using SmartSpin2k, each offering unique features and setup requirements:
- **Tablet Mode**: Ideal for those who use Peloton's digital services directly on the bike's tablet.
- **Headless Mode**: Suitable for users who prefer using third-party apps and do not use Peloton's digital services.
- **Bluetooth Mode**:  For users with power meter pedals.

Select the mode that aligns with your usage preferences, and follow the setup instructions below for your chosen mode.

{: .caution }
Peloton Bike+ owners need a power meter for compatibility with SmartSpin2k.
