# Your First Ride

If you use a BLE bike (or power meter) and BLE HR monitor, and there are no other BLE Power/HR devices near you (i.e. you don't live in an apartment), you'll be able to just get on and ride.  Before you begin, make sure you've disconnected any third-party apps that may be connected to your sensors.

{: .caution }
Peloton Bike owners should go through the [wiring instructions](peloton) before proceeding.

## Quickstart!
1. Turn on the SmartSpin2k. 
2. Turn on your HR monitor and power meter.
3. Open your preferred cycling app (Zwift, Fulgaz, TrainerRoad, etc.).
4. Pair the SmartSpin2k in those apps.

And then ride! Seriously, that's it. 

If you'd like to make changes to your shifter direction, shift steps, or other advanced settings, then you can continue with the [configuration](../documentation/configuration).
