# Homing Procedure for SmartSpin2k

## Introduction
The homing procedure allows the SmartSpin2k to precisely locate the minimum and maximum resistance positions on your bike. This ensures accurate resistance control, especially in ERG mode, and prevents the knob from turning beyond the bike's limits.

## How to Initiate Homing

1. **Start Pedaling**: Begin pedaling your bike at a moderate pace.
2. **Access Calibration**:
  * **Using the SmartSpin2k App**: Go to the workout mode, click the menu, and select "Calibrate".
  * **In your Training App**: You'll find the "Calibrate" option on the pairing screen.
3. **Stop Pedaling**: Once the SmartSpin2k starts moving the resistance knob, you can stop pedaling.

## How Homing Works

* The SmartSpin2k will first turn the resistance knob to find the minimum position.
* Next, it will turn the knob in the opposite direction to find the maximum position.
* Once both positions are found, the SmartSpin2k will return the knob to just above the minimum position.
* You'll see a "Calibration Complete" message on the screen.

## Disabling the Homing Function

1. **Open the SmartSpin2k App**: Connect to your device.
2. **Manage Power Table**: Click on the device name in the top corner, then click "Manage Power Table".
3. **Clear Active Power Table**: Click this button to disable homing and delete associated data.

## Important Notes

* **Bikes Without Stops**: Homing doesn't work on bikes without a defined minimum and maximum resistance stop.
* **Pedaling on Startup**: After rebooting the SmartSpin2k, pedal slowly to allow it to re-establish its position.
 
<!-- * **Calibration**: Calibration is generally recommended, even on bikes like the Peloton, as it provides more accurate resistance control. -->
