## Supported Bikes

The list of compatible bikes is nearly limitless. If your bike can report watts and cadence to your training app over Bluetooth, there is a very good chance it will work with SmartSpin2k. The following list represents bikes that we currently have custom-designed build kits for. They've been tested and confirmed by members of the SmartSpin2k community.  


* Bowflex C6
* Bowflex Velocore
* Echelon Connect Sport
* Joroto X2
* Le Mond Revmaster \*
* Peloton Bike (with serial data Y splitter cable)

## Automatic Resistance in Peloton Workouts
Through the use of Qdomyos-Zwift, it's possible to have automatic resistance for your instructor-guided rides in Peloton.  For this to work, you'll need to use Tablet Mode and a secondary Android/iOS device running Qdomyos-Zwift.  If you'd like to use Qdomyos-Zwift, please reach out to members of their community for help and configuration. [Learn more here.](https://www.qzfitness.com/)

## Will SmartSpin2k Fit My Bike?

In order to determine if the SmartSpin2k is compatible with your spin bike, please obtain the measurements below, preferably using calipers to generate the most accuracy. Photos with measurements overlaid in the examples below are preferred.

* Distance from back of head tube to center of resistance knob (make sure measurement is perpendicular to the resistance knob axis of rotation)

* Smallest diameter of resistance knob

* Largest diameter of resistance knob

The most critical measurement is from the back of the head tube to the center of the resistance knob on your bike. Version 2 requires a minimum of 49mm in order for SmartSpin2k to fit your bike.
