#### How do I know SS2K will fit on my bike?

In order to determine if the SmartSpin2k is compatible with your spin bike, please note the following measurements. Using calipers will generate the most accurate measurements. Photos with measurements overlaid in the examples below are preferred.

* Distance from back of head tube to center of resistance knob. Make sure measurement is perpendicular to the resistance knob axis of rotation!

* Smallest diameter of resistance knob

* Largest diameter of resistance knob

The most critical measurement is from the center of your resistance knob to the back of the head tube on your bike. Version 2 requires no less than 49mm. Anything in excess of 49mm and SS2K will fit your bike.
